# Thimdrine

Showcase website for Thimdrine, a women's cooperative of 25 members in the Nador region (Rif, Morocco). The cooperative harvests, processes and packages thyme honey, extra virgin olive oil and prickly pear jam by hand. Until now it sold only at local markets and over WhatsApp.

The president, Mme Fadma, asked for a website to present the cooperative, show its products and receive order requests. This project covers the design phase (backlog, zoning, wireframes, mockups, style guide) and the integration in plain HTML5 and CSS3.

Individual project, 5 days, YouCode Nador.
